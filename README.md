__**CascadeBot**__

CascadeBot runs on JDK 11, because we needed features from JDK 10 which is no longer supported by Oracle, so our only option was JDK 11.

**Project Owners**

Lots of talented developers have put work into CascadeBot, although the three main owners have put incredible amounts of work into CascadeBot, getting it to the stage it is now. Here's some more information about them:

BinaryOverload: BinaryOverload#2382 https://github.com/binaryoverload
MrJvs: mrjvs#2165 https://github.com/mrjvs

**Credits**

Although we haven't taken code directly from them, the projects listed in the `licences` have provided inspiration, and we thought we'd mention them:
